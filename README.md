Project Description
This is a console-based Quiz Management System developed in C++.
The system allows students to log in and attempt a quiz, while an
admin can manage quiz questions. File handling is used to store
student data and quiz questions.

---

Objectives
- To develop a simple quiz system using C++
- To implement student and admin login
- To practice file handling concepts
- To calculate quiz scores automatically

---
